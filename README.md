# InsulinNof1
Analysis of my simple, personal N-of-1 trial comparing Fiasp to Humalog. Set up as simple 20-block N-of-1 trial with random allocation of the two treatments. Triple blinded and analyzed using combination of linear mixed effects model and logistic regression, GEE model. Both considering strong correlation between repeated measures from CGM using 1 degree autoregressive covariance structure.
Project contains all neccessary data and R + SAS code to execute the analyses. The SAS part is probably possible to run using R, but I just wasn't able to get the GEE model to compute.
